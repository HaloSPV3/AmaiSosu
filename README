HXE.DETECT
==========

HXE.Detect is a nimble library and CLI for heuristically inferring the
path of the HCE executable on the filesystem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

USAGE
-----

HXE.Detect can be used as both a CLI and as a library. This means that a
calling project doesn't need to be a .NET solution or even a program.

Indeed, wise humans may directly use this too.

CLI

Invoking the CLI will automatically attempt to infer the path of the
executable on the filesystem.

Refer to the following table for information on the output and exit
procedure of the CLI:

  outcome     output                         exit code
  ----------- ------------------------------ -----------
  exe found   stdout: executable full path   0
  not found   stderr: "not found"            1

LIB

The Detection static class in HXE.Detect contains the static Infer()
method, which:

-   returns a FileInfo representing the found HCE executable;
-   returns null if the executable is not found on the filesystem;
-   attempts to infer the executable path using all available methods.

For granularity, the Detection class also exposes the following static
methods:

  method                        description
  ----------------------------- ---------------------------------------------
  InferFromCurrentDirectory()   finds exe in the current/working directory
  InferFromProgramFilesPath()   finds exe in the program files directories
  InferFromRegistryKeyEntry()   finds exe in the windows registry hce entry

In similar fashion to Infer(), the aforementioned methods will return:

-   a FileInfo instance representing the found executable if the path
    exists; or
-   null if the executable cannot be found on the filesystem at any
    declared paths.
