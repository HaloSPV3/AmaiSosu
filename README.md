# Introduction

AmaiSosu is an installer for the HCE OpenSauce mod, which seeks to make the
installation much more straightforward and easy. It serves as the successor of
SweetSauce, in both its name and in its functionality.

AmaiSosu installs the OpenSauce library data to the given HCE directory path,
and it also installs in-game UI for configuring OpenSauce. If OpenSauce/HAC2
files are present in the given HCE directory path, it will back them up to a
directory named `AmaiSosu.Backup.<GUID>`. HAC2 is incompatible with OS, thus it
will be deactivated to ensure that there is no collision.

## Features

- installation of the OpenSauce libraries and in-game settings user interface;
- installation of OpenSauce development tools (`OS_Guerilla`, `OS_Sapien`,
  `OS_Tool`, etc.);
- installation of the OpenSauce IDE to the HCE directory, for
  self-containerisation & convenience;
- automatic back-up of existing OpenSauce data in the HCE directory (both files
  and folders);
- automatic back-up & deactivation of HAC2 if it exists, due to its
  incompatibility with OpenSauce;
- automatic detection attempt of a legally installed HCE directory for an even
  easier installation;
- automatic installation when bundled with SPV3;
- ability to manually specify a HCE directory, for portable/non-standard HCE
  installations;
- minimum administrative requirements -- they are only needed if HCE is
  installed a restricted location;
- minimum .NET Framework required is 4.5, which comes built-in as of Windows 8
  -- no need for multiple .NET versions;
- dependencies used by OpenSauce (e.g. MSVCR) are all installed to the HCE
  directory rather than on the system.

## Usage

1. Download the installer and run it with administrative permissions.
2. If HCE is legally installed, its path should be detected. Just click Install,
   and you're done!
3. However, if the path is not found, please click on browse and look for
   `haloce.exe` on your computer. Then, you can click Install and be done!

### Portable Installations

OpenSauce 4.0.0 (2015) and 4.0.1 (2017) require the following files at *non-portable* paths:
| Usage                     | File Path
| ------------------------- | ---------
| In-game config overlay(?) | `C:\\ProgramData\\Kornner Studios\\Halo CE\\OpenSauceUI.pak`
| Geometry Buffer shaders   | `C:\\ProgramData\\Kornner Studios\\Halo CE\\shaders\\gbuffer_shaders.shd`
| Post-Processing shaders   | `C:\\ProgramData\\Kornner Studios\\Halo CE\\shaders\\pp_shaders.shd`

~~For users out there with alternative HCE installations in conformist
environments, download the installer and extract it using 7-Zip or WinRAR. Then,
run the extracted `AmaiSosu.GUI.exe` executable without admin permissions and
install it to your portable HCE directory.~~

~~Note that attempting to install AmaiSosu to HCE in a restricted location (e.g.
`Program Files\Microsoft Games\`) without admin permissions will cause issues!~~
